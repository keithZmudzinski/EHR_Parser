This 65 y.o. man presents with intermittent dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headaches, bleeding and diarrhea of about 1 week duration. Over this period of time, she has been unable to take in any significant PO intake without vomiting. Her dizziness and lightheadedness are most notable when she stands up, and she has difficulty maintaining her balance due to this. She also notes that has been very tired for this past week, spending approximately 20 hours per day in bed sleeping. She denies pain, headache, fevers, chills, chest pain, hematemesis, bloody stool, tarry stool, dysuria, hematuria, and increased bleeding or bruising. The patient is unable to provide further details or further describe her symptoms, and has no idea what might be causing them. She does deny any recent sick contacts, eating any new or abnormal foods, eating any potentially raw meats, and drinking large amounts of tonic water, or anything else that contains quinine.

Evaluation for response. COMPARISON: Previous chest CT scan from **DATE[Oct 04 2007]. TECHNIQUE: Helical CT imaging of the chest was obtained without intravenous or oral contrast with contiguous 5.0mm thick axial reconstructions using both lung and standard reconstruction algorithms. FINDINGS: The areas of patchy airspace consolidation in the left upper lobe have resolved. There has been near complete resolution of the left lower lobe pneumonia. The left pleural effusion has resolved. There is persistent extensive dense consolidation in the right upper lobe which has decreased. The areas of airspace consolidation in the right lower lobe and right middle lobe have decreased. IMPRESSION: 1. PERSISTENT VERY EXTENSIVE CONSOLIDATION IN THE RIGHT UPPER LOBE (WITH NORMAL PATENT AIRWAYS). THE DEGREE AND EXTENT OF RIGHT UPPER LOBE CONSOLIDATION HAVE DEFINITELY DECREASED FROM THE PREVIOUS STUDY OF **DATE[Oct 04 2007] CONSISTENT WITH RESOLVING PNEUMONIA. THERE ARE NO FINDINGS TO INDICATE ENDOBRONCHIAL OBSTRUCTING LESIONS. 2. INTERVAL DECREASE IN AREAS OF AIRSPACE CONSOLIDATION AND RIGHT LOWER LOBE AND RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE. 3. NEAR COMPLETE RESOLUTION OF AREAS OF CONSOLIDATION IN LEFT UPPER LOBE AND LEFT LOWER LOBE. 4. RESOLVED LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION. My signature below is attestation that I have interpreted this/these examination(s) and agree with the findings as noted above. END OF IMPRESSION:
